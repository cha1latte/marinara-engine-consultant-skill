# Character Cards

Characters in Marinara Engine follow the **V2 Character Card spec** (`chara_card_v2`), with Marinara-specific extensions. A character is a JSON object stored via Marinara's file-native storage (under `DATA_DIR/storage`; SQLite is legacy) and rendered through the Characters Panel UI.

**Source of truth:** `packages/shared/src/schemas/character.schema.ts` and `packages/server/src/db/seed-mari.ts` (the built-in Professor Mari assistant is the canonical example of a complex card).

## The V2 Card Schema

```typescript
{
  name: string,                     // required
  description: string,              // the main character description
  personality: string,              // traits, speech style, quirks
  scenario: string,                 // the setting / framing
  first_mes: string,                // the character's opening message
  mes_example: string,              // example dialogue (teaches the model voice)
  creator_notes: string,            // not sent to model; for other users
  system_prompt: string,            // overrides the user's global system prompt
  post_history_instructions: string, // instructions inserted after message history
  tags: string[],
  creator: string,
  character_version: string,
  alternate_greetings: string[],    // shuffleable alternate first messages
  extensions: {                     // Marinara-specific
    talkativeness: number,          // 0-1; affects autonomous messaging rate
    fav: boolean,
    world: string,                  // linked lorebook name
    depth_prompt: {
      prompt: string,
      depth: number,                // how many messages from the end to inject at
      role: "system" | "user" | "assistant",
    },
    backstory: string,
    appearance: string,
    // Typed Marinara display fields (first-class in the schema, not just passthrough):
    nameColor: string,              // CSS color or gradient for the character's name
    dialogueColor: string,          // quoted dialogue is bold + colored with this
    boxColor: string,               // chat bubble / dialogue box background
    conversationStatus: "online" | "idle" | "dnd" | "offline",
    rpgStats: {                     // RPG stats toggle + custom attributes
      enabled: boolean,
      attributes: { name: string, value: number }[],   // e.g. STR / DEX / CHA
      hp: { value: number, max: number },
    },
    isBuiltInAssistant: boolean,    // Mari only
    // Conversation-mode-only fields (optional; absent on non-convo cards) — see below:
    convoDisplayName: string,       // sender label distinct from `name`
    convoDisplayNameInCard: boolean, // toggle: declare the display name in the prompt
    aboutMe: string,                // Discord-style "about me" blurb
    convoBehavior: {                // Conversation-only behavior directive
      instruction: string,
      insertionStrategy: "constant_before" | "constant_after" | "post_history_replace"
        | "post_history_before" | "post_history_after" | "macro",  // default constant_after
    },
    aboutMeSources: { ... },        // legacy (v2.3): former AI-write source picker; no longer surfaced by the editors
    // (the extensions object still allows arbitrary passthrough keys too)
  },
  // phoneticName lives as a top-level character/persona column (not in extensions):
  phoneticName: string,             // pronunciation spelling for Conversation Call TTS
  character_book: CharacterBook | null,  // embedded lorebook (optional)
}
```

## Where Each Field Shows Up in the Prompt

Not all fields get sent to the model on every turn. Here's roughly what happens:

| Field | Sent to model? | When? |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Always, as the character identifier. |
| `description` | yes | Core system prompt on every turn. Usually the biggest block. |
| `personality` | yes | Its own section, immediately after `description`. |
| `scenario` | yes | As a separate section; sets the framing. |
| `first_mes` | yes | Only as the first assistant turn. Not re-sent afterward. |
| `mes_example` | yes | The last card section in the prompt (after `scenario`); teaches the model voice. |
| `system_prompt` | yes | Replaces the preset's system prompt section if non-empty. |
| `post_history_instructions` | yes | Inserted at the end, after recent messages. |
| `tags`, `creator`, `creator_notes` | no | Metadata, not sent to model. |
| `extensions.appearance` | yes | An ordered card section (between `backstory` and `scenario`); also used in image generation. |
| `extensions.backstory` | yes | An ordered card section (between `personality` and `appearance`). |
| `extensions.depth_prompt` | yes | Inserted at N messages deep. |
| `extensions.talkativeness` | no (structurally) | Used by autonomous messaging logic. |
| `character_book` (embedded lorebook) | yes | Entries trigger normally based on keywords. |

**Practical implication:** anything you want the model to *always* know goes in `description` / `personality` / `system_prompt`. Anything it only needs when a keyword is mentioned goes in the lorebook (either character-scoped or a separate file).

**(v2.2)** The advanced prompt fields — `system_prompt`, `post_history_instructions`, and `extensions.depth_prompt` — now apply across **Conversation and Game modes too**, not just Roleplay. A card built for Conversation can carry the same system/post-history/depth steering it would in Roleplay.

**(v2.3.4)** Card sections keep a **guaranteed order** in the prompt — Description → Personality → Backstory → Appearance → Scenario → then Example Dialogue when present — and that order holds across preset markers, fallbacks, agent lore, and Game/scene card contexts (#3817).

**(v2.3.4)** Field content reaches the model **verbatim**: angle brackets in card fields, persona, lorebook entries, memories, and scene text are no longer HTML-escaped, so `<thinking>`, `<scenario>`, or an inline `<div>` pass through exactly as written. Deliberate XML/HTML markup is now a supported authoring tool (structural section wrappers and agent value/attribute escapers are unchanged) — see Common Mistakes for the flip side.

## Character vs. Persona: A Critical Distinction

**Character** = an AI entity the user chats with.
**Persona** = the user's own identity in the chat.

They have similar fields but serve opposite roles. If the user asks "how do I give my character a detailed backstory," you're building a character. If they ask "how do I tell the AI about *me*," you're building a persona. The engine substitutes `{{user}}` in prompts with the active persona's name and injects the persona's data into the prompt too. **(v2.3)** Two caveats: a **Roleplay chat created with no Persona stays persona-less end-to-end** (first snapshot, provider prompt, scene generation, combat context) — only Conversation falls back to the globally active Persona. And `{{user}}` / `{{char}}` and other macros in `first_mes`, alternate greetings, and `/guided` instructions now resolve at the **final provider boundary** — including lorebook routing and embedding scans — so raw placeholders can no longer reach the model (#3704). **(v2.3.4)** Name Prefix History is now **persona-accurate per turn**: historical user turns stay labeled with the Persona that actually sent them, so switching Personas no longer rewrites earlier prefixes.

**(v2.3)** Both a character's metadata and a persona's lead their primary identity block with a clearly labeled **avatar upload/replace field** (same upload/crop flow as the editor portrait), above **Name** and the **Title / comment** field (synced with the editor-header field) — a short human label for the card, distinct from the model-facing `name`. **(v2.3)** Personas also gained an **Open Full Library** mirroring the Character Library — card grid, search, sorting, preview pane, paging, scroll restoration, and the editor return flow; both libraries use the Settings chroma text color. **(v2.3.4)** Editor polish: tracker-card color settings preview immediately and persist, and cropped avatars stay contained in their editor upload targets and no longer hijack page clicks (#3741/#3939).

## Conversation-mode Profile

These fields live on the character/persona `extensions` schema (`character.schema.ts:30-74`) and are **Conversation-mode only** — they're never sent in Roleplay / VN / Game mode. Characters and personas carry the same profile columns, and Professor Mari's `character.create` / `persona.create` (and `mari personas create`) can populate them.

- **`convoDisplayName`** — a live sender label shown above the character's messages, distinct from the card `name`. The **`convoDisplayNameInCard`** toggle additionally declares the display name inside the prompt so the model maps it back to the card — mainly useful in **group Conversations**, where generation instructions, speaker parsing, labels, typing events, and base-name matching all honor it.
- **`aboutMe`** — a Discord-style "about me" blurb surfaced in the participant popout. **(v2.3)** AI drafting now goes through **Professor Mari**: she inspects the saved character/persona, writes the bio in their voice, and saves it to the real `aboutMe` field. The Character and Persona Convo editors no longer expose a separate model connection or source settings for it — the old gear-icon source picker is gone, and **`aboutMeSources`** survives only as a **legacy schema field** the editors don't surface. The field itself is unchanged.
- **Per-chat about-me override** — separate from the card default. In Conversation mode, click a participant's avatar to set/edit/clear a **chat-specific** about-me that supersedes the card default in that one conversation (Discord per-server-profile style; pairs with the `update_about_me` tool's `chat` scope).
- **`convoBehavior`** — a Conversation-only behavior directive (`instruction` text plus an `insertionStrategy`). Strategies: `constant_before`, `constant_after` (default), `post_history_replace`, `post_history_before`, `post_history_after`, and `macro` (place it yourself with `{{convo_behavior}}`).
- **`phoneticName`** (top-level column, `phonetic_name`) — a pronunciation spelling used by Conversation Call TTS. Exposed via `{{charNamePhonetic}}` / `{{userNamePhonetic}}`, which fall back to `{{char}}` / `{{user}}` when empty.

### Conversation macros

Conversation mode registers a `Conversation` macro category (`packages/shared/src/utils/macro-engine.ts:284-363`). Profile macros pull the fields above: `{{convo_display}}`, `{{char_about}}`, `{{persona_about}}`, `{{convo_behavior}}`. **Relocation macros** move an auto-inserted block to where you place it (and skip its automatic insertion): `{{context}}` / `{{status}}`, `{{commands}}`, `{{reactRules}}`, `{{replyRules}}`, `{{memories}}`, `{{lorebook}}`.

**(v2.3.4)** Two macro additions usable in card text generally (not Conversation-only): **`{{group}}`** expands to every other active chat character — it works during targeted Roleplay group generation too, and the full roster is kept available in manual group generation so it never resolves empty — and **conditional prompt macros** now support `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), parentheses, and an equality-list shorthand, with examples in-app.

### Theming the about-me popout

The Card CSS Theming Guide exposes **`mari-about-me-*` hooks** (e.g. `mari-about-me-popout`, `-box`, `-banner`, `-avatar`, `-name`, `-handle`, `-status`, `-badge`, `-text`), so the Conversation about-me popout is themable straight from **Creator Notes** CSS — and personas can now ship their own creator-notes CSS for their popout too.

## The Professor Mari Pattern

Mari is Marinara's built-in assistant (seeded at first run, cannot be deleted; see `packages/server/src/db/seed-mari.ts`). **As of v2.0 she is the Home-screen assistant, not a normal Conversation-mode chat character** — users talk to her from the Home screen, where a Pi-backed *workspace agent* can inspect the local app and request browser approval for database changes (`packages/server/src/services/professor-mari/workspace-agent.service.ts`; route `POST /api/professor-mari/workspace`). Her card is still the canonical example of a "does-things" assistant. Her definition demonstrates:

### Heavy use of an injected `system_prompt` for domain knowledge
Mari's `system_prompt` is blank in her card, but the server injects a large `MARI_ASSISTANT_PROMPT` when she's the active assistant — the injection is gated by the hardcoded `PROFESSOR_MARI_ID` (`generate.routes.ts`). It contains:
- `<assistant_role>` — framing ("you are not a generic AI, you live inside this app")
- `<app_knowledge>` — the actual Marinara Engine documentation, XML-tagged by section
- `<assistant_commands>` — the hidden actions she can emit (below)
- `<data_access>` — how to use `[fetch: ...]` to load items on demand

**For a custom character with a lot of domain knowledge:** either do what Mari does structurally (large `description` + `system_prompt` with XML-tagged sections) or use a lorebook for the reference material. **(v2.3.4)** The XML-tagged-sections pattern now fully applies to user-authored cards too: leaf content reaches the model verbatim, so your own tags pass through exactly as written (see "Where Each Field Shows Up in the Prompt").

### What Mari can actually do (v2.0)
Her hidden actions are content-creation + navigation helpers, not a generic agent (`docs/PROFESSOR_MARI.md`): create personas, create/update character cards, update personas, create lorebooks (optionally with starter entries), create Conversation/Roleplay chats, navigate to panels/settings tabs, fetch existing items to inspect before advising/editing, and read public Fandom/MediaWiki pages. She is a guide that takes a few *safe* actions — she fetches an item before editing it, and she does **not** run the full Game-Mode setup wizard for you. Beyond the seed-prompt content commands, her Home-screen *workspace agent* can also create/edit **agents, custom tools, and themes** via a `mari` CLI (`mari db` over `agent_configs`/`custom_tools`, `mari themes`), requesting browser approval before database changes. **(v2.3.4)** Mari no longer creates or edits browser extensions — the extension feature was removed from the engine, and her extension instructions went with it.

**(v2.3)** Mari also drafts Conversation **About Me** bios: she inspects the saved character/persona, writes the blurb in their voice, and saves it to the real `aboutMe` field (the per-editor AI Write controls were removed — see the Conversation-mode Profile section). And her card/app-data updates are **field-safe**: partial updates via Mari (or any app-data caller) preserve unrelated fields — greetings, example dialogue, creator notes, system prompts, post-history instructions, character versions, and alternate greetings all survive an update to some other field (#3708); blank Mari generation turns were fixed and lorebook creation made atomic (#3674). **(v2.3.4)** The same field safety now extends to the HTTP layer: partial nested `PATCH /api/characters/:id` requests deep-merge without materializing destructive defaults (#3858) — see API Endpoints.

**(v2.1)** Mari's **preset** support is now *structured*: `app_data` `preset.create` / `preset.update` commands can build prompt groups, prompt sections, and preset variables/choice blocks in a **single reversible operation** (#3207). *(Contributor note: `pnpm mari -- --help` at the repo root exposes the built Mari CLI from a source checkout (#3208); its flag parser was fixed so boolean flags like `--tail`/`--raw`/`--patch` no longer swallow positional args (#3222).)*

### Command protocol vs. real tool calling
Mari uses a **custom regex-parsed command protocol** (`[create_persona: ...]`, `[create_character: ...]`, `[fetch: ...]`, `[navigate: ...]`). This is NOT public — you can't add new meta-commands of your own.

**For custom characters that need to do things, use real Custom Tools** (see `references/custom-tools.md`). They're better supported, use proper OpenAI function-calling, and can be integrated with real backends.

### Personality in character voice
Mari's card description is ~280 words and includes voice, quirks, speech patterns, backstory, appearance, and a few behavioral rules. That's a solid starting length — long enough to establish voice, short enough not to dominate the context window.

### `isBuiltInAssistant: true`
This flag is Mari-specific. The special **prompt injection** is gated by the hardcoded `PROFESSOR_MARI_ID` (not by this flag), so setting the flag on your own character won't make the server inject Mari's assistant prompt or turn it into Mari. The flag itself *does* still drive some scenario/prompt handling (e.g. stripping `<assistant_capabilities>` and a conversation-route branch — `character-prompt-context.ts`, `conversation.routes.ts`), so it isn't entirely inert.

## Recommended Card Structure for Different Use Cases

### Pure roleplay character (fictional persona, creative writing)
- `description` — detailed physical and personality description (~300–800 words)
- `personality` — speech patterns, quirks, MBTI/tropes if useful, behavioral examples
- `scenario` — the setting/context; can be short
- `first_mes` — a compelling opening that establishes voice
- `mes_example` — 2–3 example dialogue exchanges showing voice
- `extensions.appearance` — for image gen (selfies, sprites)
- Lorebook — world info, other NPCs, locations

### "Expert assistant" character (like Mari, for a specific domain)
- `description` — who they are, their expertise, how they speak (~200–400 words)
- `personality` — shorter; focus on how they respond to users
- `system_prompt` — the domain reference material, XML-tagged
- `first_mes` — greeting + menu of what they can help with
- Custom tools — for any actions they can take (see `references/custom-tools.md`)

### "Live data" character (answers questions against current data)
- `description` — thin; mostly voice and framing
- `personality` — how they respond (concise, data-forward, etc.)
- `system_prompt` — rules for using tools ("always call `get_latest` before answering")
- Custom tools — webhook-based, one per lookup type
- Lorebook — any stable background context that doesn't fit in the card

### Group chat member
- Normal character fields, plus:
- `extensions.talkativeness` — tune based on how vocal they should be. **(v2.1)** In merged group Conversations, autonomous-message accounting (saved attribution, follow-up count, per-character daily budget) is charged to the *selected* autonomous character, not the first group member (#3299).
- Clear `personality` — distinguishable voice from other group members
- Lorebook — shared group lore if applicable
- **(v2.3.4)** The **`{{group}}`** macro expands to every other active chat character — including during targeted/manual Roleplay group generation, where the full roster is kept available so it never resolves empty.
- **(v2.3.4)** Roleplay group chats support **per-character Hide From AI**: avatar-based multi-selection, recipient markers, and character-scoped prompt history. The global hide option is preserved.

## Import/Export

Characters can be imported from:
- **SillyTavern** — granular per-type import (v2.0 improved the mappings): `st-character` (+ inspect/batch), `st-lorebook`, `st-preset`, `st-chat`, plus `st-bulk/scan` + `st-bulk/run` for importing a whole folder at once (all under `/api/import/*`). Handles characters, lorebooks, presets, and chat history.
- **PNG files with embedded metadata** — the V2 spec standard. Drop the PNG into the Characters panel.
- **JSON files** — raw V2 card JSON.
- **Chub.ai, CharacterTavern, JannyAI, Pygmalion, Wyvern, DataCat** — all searchable from the in-app **Card Browser**. **(v2.3)** Renamed from *Bot Browser*; the *Browse Online* entry point is now **Download Cards**, and the online browser opens as the **Cards Library** in the shared library shell. Provider fetches (Chub/CharacterTavern/Wyvern) were consolidated behind `safeFetch` (#3617).

Characters can be exported as:
- JSON (via the export endpoint)
- PNG with embedded V2 card metadata (via the export endpoint)

## Sprite System

Characters can have expression sprites for VN-style overlays in roleplay mode. Sprites live in a folder keyed to the character; filenames are expression names (`happy.png`, `sad.png`, `angry.png`, `smug.png`, etc.). The Expression Engine agent picks the matching sprite per message. There's also an automated sprite generation feature (uses image gen + a pose prompt) introduced in recent versions. **(v2.1)** Expression portraits can additionally be generated as short *animated* sprites: the Expression Engine can drive a Video Generation connection to produce a brief expression clip, convert it to a looping GIF, and save it into the expression slot. Clip length is set under `Advanced > Video Generation` (`animatedExpressionClipDurationSeconds`, default 3s, range 1–8) alongside prompt templates (`packages/shared/src/constants/video-generation-settings.ts`; `packages/server/src/routes/sprites.routes.ts`).

**(v2.3)** Sprite transparency is now **native-alpha-first**: generated sprites prefer the provider's native alpha channel. For providers that can't return transparent PNGs, the pipeline falls back to a subject-aware saturated chroma matte → border-connected soft matting → color despill; the neural background remover is reserved for genuinely complex backgrounds. Legacy white-background sprites remain cleanable, with restore points.

**(v2.3.4)** Sprite downloads route through the **Android native file saver**, and on mobile the editor stacks the Upload control under each expression field (#3884).

## Sprites → Clips (Video-Call Presence) (v2.1)

Distinct from the VN expression **Sprite System** above, both the **Character *and* Persona editors** gained a **Sprites → Clips** tab holding reusable *video-call presence clips* — short avatar videos played during Conversation-mode audio/video calls. There are **six fixed clip kinds** — `idle`, `talking`, `laughing`, `angry`, `crying`, `sighing` (`CONVERSATION_CALL_CHARACTER_VIDEO_CLIP_KINDS`, `packages/shared/src/types/conversation-call.ts:10-26`) — plus **named custom clips**, capped at **128 per character** (`CUSTOM_CLIP_LIMIT = 128`, `packages/server/src/services/conversation/call-character-videos.service.ts:115`).

Each clip carries a `status` (`missing | generating | ready | error`) and an `origin` (`generated | uploaded`). Clips can be **generated per-slot** from an empty or errored card (no full batch required) or **uploaded as MP4** (bounded by `CALL_VIDEO_CLIP_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`); uploads support **non-destructive trim** via `trimStartSeconds` / `trimEndSeconds` (`conversation-call.ts:95-96,109-110`). The per-character/-persona manifest is `ConversationCallCharacterVideoManifest` (`clips[]` + `customClips[]`, `conversation-call.ts:88-121`), served at `GET /api/characters/:id/gallery/clips` (`packages/server/src/routes/characters.routes.ts:768`).

### Character Video Presence
When `callCharacterVideoEnabled` is on (`packages/shared/src/types/tts.ts:146`, default `false`) Marinara uses the **'Default for Videos'** connection to play these cached avatar clips **in-call**, cued from TTS output and returning to `idle` after speech. `callAutomaticVideoClipsEnabled` (`tts.ts:148`) auto-generates the minimum `idle`/`talking` clips. (The clips themselves are produced by the Video Generation subsystem — see `references/architecture.md`.)

### In-call commands ([custom_clip], [react:])
In **call-only** chat a character can emit two hidden, engine-parsed commands. These are regex-parsed like Mari's protocol (below) and are **engine-emitted & gated, not user-authorable meta-commands or public custom tools** — a card author does not write them into `first_mes`/`mes_example`:
- `[custom_clip: label="short title", prompt="visual action or look"]` — generates one custom call clip and saves it into that character's **Sprites → Clips** custom library (cap 128). Note the **real bracket-arg syntax** (a `label` and a `prompt`); a bare `[custom_clip]` is *not* valid. Double-gated by `callCharacterVideoEnabled && callCustomVideoClipsEnabled` (`tts.ts:150`) and only offered when a video connection exists (`packages/server/src/routes/conversation-calls.routes.ts:736-740,1060`).
- `[react: emoji="😂"]` (also `[react: emoji=":custom_name:"]`) — reacts to the user's latest written call message (`conversation-calls.routes.ts:734`).

(The broader Conversation-mode `[react:]` grammar, including character-to-character targeting, is documented in `references/architecture.md`.)

## Common Mistakes

- **Putting everything in `description`** — fine up to ~1000 words, bad past that. Split into `personality`, `scenario`, and `system_prompt` (or use a lorebook).
- **Writing examples in narrative instead of dialogue** — `mes_example` is for teaching voice. Show dialogue exchanges, not backstory. **(v2.3.4)** All prompt leaf content now reaches the model **verbatim** — `<START>` needs no special-casing, and angle-bracket markup / inline HTML in card fields, persona, lorebooks, memories, and scene text passes through exactly as written. You can use XML tags and HTML deliberately, but proofread for stray pseudo-XML, because that goes to the model as-is too. (Supersedes the v2.3 #3623 escaping model; structural section wrappers and agent value/attribute escapers are unchanged.)
- **Forgetting `first_mes`** — without it, the character opens the chat with nothing, and the model often misinterprets silence.
- **Setting `system_prompt` without understanding it replaces the preset's system prompt** — you lose any framing the preset provides. Usually you want to leave `system_prompt` blank unless you specifically need to override.
- **Not setting `extensions.appearance`** — breaks selfie generation and image prompts.
- **Using purple-prose descriptions** — cram too many adjectives in and the model starts writing florid overwrought prose. Be concrete.
- **Expecting the character to "remember" stuff you didn't put in a prompt** — the card + lorebook + history is all the model sees. If you want persistence outside a chat, use a tool that writes to your own backend.
- **"Missing" characters that are really a stale filter** — on ≤2.3.2, a saved Character-panel search/tag/favorite filter could persist and hide cards. **(v2.3)** Panel filters are now session-only (stale ones were reset); Full Library sorting and position preferences still persist.

## API Endpoints

Characters (`/api/characters`, non-exhaustive — see `packages/server/src/routes/characters.routes.ts`). **(v2.3.4)** The editor's **Copy ID** control (handy for grabbing the `:id` these routes take) now works on mobile and non-secure contexts, with confirmed-success reporting (#3851).
- `GET /` — list; `GET /:id` — one
- `POST /` — create; `PATCH /:id` — update; `DELETE /:id` — delete. **(v2.3.4)** Partial nested `PATCH`es **deep-merge** without materializing destructive defaults — omitted `extensions` keys and embedded-lorebook data survive (#3858) — and native cards are validated/normalized **before persistence**, preserving unknown embedded-lorebook properties (#3859).
- `GET /:id/export` (JSON, with a `format` querystring) **and** `GET /:id/export-png` (PNG with embedded V2 metadata) — these are **two separate endpoints**, not one parameterized export
- `POST /export-bulk` — bulk export
- `POST /:id/duplicate`; `GET /:id/versions`, `POST /:id/versions/:versionId/restore`
- `GET /:id/gallery` (+ `/gallery/upload`, `/gallery/:imageId`), `POST /:id/avatar`, `DELETE /:id/avatar`
- **(v2.1)** Galleries now hold **images *and* videos** — Character/Persona galleries split into **Images / Videos** tabs (the old 'clips' were renamed 'Videos'). Video + clip routes (persona mirror ~`characters.routes.ts:1823`): `GET /:id/gallery/videos/file/:filename`, `POST /:id/gallery/videos/upload`, `POST /:id/gallery/clips/upload`, `PATCH /:id/gallery/clips/:clipId/trim`, `DELETE /:id/gallery/clips/:clipId`. MP4 upload for both gallery videos and Sprites → Clips, non-destructive trim, and delete; custom-clip library capped at 128, uploads bounded by `CALL_VIDEO_CLIP_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`.
- `POST /:id/embedded-lorebook/import`
- Groups: `GET /groups/list`, `GET /groups/:id`, `POST /groups`, `PATCH /groups/:id`, `DELETE /groups/:id` (note `/groups/list`, not `GET /groups`)

**Import is a separate router at `/api/import/*`** — there is no `POST /api/characters/import`. Relevant endpoints: `POST /api/import/st-character` (+ `/st-character/inspect`, `/st-character/batch`), `POST /api/import/marinara`, `POST /api/import/marinara-package`, plus `/st-preset`, `/st-lorebook`, `/st-bulk/scan`, `/st-bulk/run` (`packages/server/src/routes/import.routes.ts`).

*(AI-assisted character generation moved to `POST /api/professor-mari/workspace` in v2.0; the old `/api/character-maker/generate` route and its maker modal were removed.)*
